# Type with Remote on ATV

This is more of a test than anything. There is no easy way to fill in text fields on Apple TV programmatically. This script uses left, right and select on the remote to type whatever string is passed in.

## Usage

1. Install pyatv: `pip install pyatv`
2. Pair with an Apple TV: `python ps_simple.py`
3. Navigate your Apple TV to a search field with the default keyboard.
4. Run `typer_test.py "Hello this is a test"`
